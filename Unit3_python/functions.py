# What is a function?

# A fucntion is a set of intructions that preforms a specific 
# task or job

# there are two variations of functions in Python
# Built-in functions- instructions that are pre-written in python programming language

# print() is a built in function. When we pass data it will output it into the terminal automatically
print('Coding Class') 
# input() is a built in function. it allows us to write and pass data into our programs from the terminal
name = input('what is your name')
print(name)

number = int(input('please provide a number'))
print()
