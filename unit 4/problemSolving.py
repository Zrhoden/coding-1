# CALCULATOR APP
# You have been tasked with developing a calculator 
# app that students can use during their standardized test. 
# The calculator should be able to take in a number, followed by an 
# arithmetic operator and then another number. Once your 
# program has all of these components, it should return the answer. 

#  1. What is the problem asking you to do?
'your answers should be in string format...'

# 2. What are some keywords and phrases ? 

# 3. Is there input data that the question provides ?

# 4. What is the desired output ?

# ROCK, PAPER, SCISSOR GAME APP
# You are working on a game concept with several 
# other engineers and you need to provide them with a
#  simple proof of concepts. 
# For now, you have suggested that your 
# game work on a RPS (rock, paper, scissors) loop. 
# When a user plays, rock, paper, or scissors, 
# the computer will randomly select one of the 3 
# options as well. Your program will then determine 
# who won, based on the values. The game should only 
# allow the player to play 3 hands, and inform the 
# player if the won or lost (best 2 out of 3 format.) 

#  1. What is the problem asking you to do?
'we need a basic rps game with a best 2 out of 3 format'
# 2. What are some keywords and phrases ? 
'random select from program'
# 3. Is there input data that the question provides ?
'we need to take in the users RPS selection'
# 4. What is the desired output ?
'shows which player won or loss'
# 5. Pseudocode Steps & Additional Notes 
' import random, random.range() random.choice'
'needs to have logic to determine who won after three turns, as well ask the player if they want to play again WE NEED TO LOOP'
'if / else conditions to determine which options win, ex i user selects rock and cpu selects paper == cpu wins'
'Need a variable to track if user or cpu wins'

# Solution

    print('what would you like to choose?')
